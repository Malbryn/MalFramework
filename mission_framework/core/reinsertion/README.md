# Reinsertion
## Description:
_This module handles the reinsertion of players after respawn._

_Available options:_
```
 - HALO drop (High Altitude, Low Opening)
        * The player will be dropped in near their corpse with a parachute on the back (any backpack will be put on chest)

 - MRV (Mobile Respawn Vehicle)
        * A vehicle will be assigned as a respawn vehicle and the players can teleport into this vehicle

 - RP (Rally Point)
        * Players with squad level leadership (see: Player module) can deploy a rally point for their squad
        * People from their squad can TP to that RP (each squad has a different RP)

 - HAB (basically a RP for the entire platoon)
        * Players with platoon level leadership (see: Player module) can deploy a HAB for the platoon
        * Any player can TP to the HAB
        * If enabled, players can TP from the HAB to their squad's RP

 - TP (Teleport Pole)
        * Teleport destinations can be created dynamically during the mission (via triggers), so players can TP to captured FOB's etc.
```

## Usage:
1. _Place down a teleport pole (or any object) at the respawn area and give it a unique name_

### MRV:
2. _Put down a vehicle that should be the respawn vehicle_
3. _Call `MF_reinsertion_fnc_setMRV_` in the init field of the vehicle_

```
Arguments:
    0: OBJECT - Vehicle that should become a MRV

Example:
    [this] call MF_reinsertion_fnc_setMRV
```

### Dynamic TP pole:
2. _Place down a trigger that unlocks TP locations dynamically (e.g. every enemy is killed in the FOB)_
2. _Call `MF_reinsertion_fnc_createTPDestination` in the Activation field of the trigger_

```
Arguments:
    0: STRING - Name of the destination that appears in the scroll wheel menu
    1: ARRAY - Coordinates of the destination

Example:
    ["Kavala City Centre", getMarkerPos "marker_kavala"] call MF_reinsertion_fnc_createTPDestination
```
