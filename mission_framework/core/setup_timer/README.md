# Setup Timer
## Description:
_This module starts a setup timer at mission start, during which the players can't leave a designated area._

_Players who leave the area will be teleported back into it._

_It's useful during TvT mission so the defenders have some extra time to set up their defenses but it can be used in Coop missions too._

## Usage:
1. _Place down area marker(s) for the selected side(s), give it (them) unique name(s)_

## Config:
_Description of each value set in the config file._
