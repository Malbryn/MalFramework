Welcome to **Malbryn's Mission Framework**. This framework was made for my Arma 3 scripted missions and it is based on some other Arma 3 mission frameworks and other scripts. Their original authors are credited in the script headers as well as in the Credits section in-game. This script library is compatible with both PvE and TvT missions.

If something is broken, contact **[Malbryn](https://www.fkgaming.eu/profile/4189-malbryn/)** or open a new issue on **[GitHub](https://github.com/Malbryn/MalFramework/issues)**.
